How do you organize your code? What are some suggestions you find on the web?
I organize my code by keeping it in files that are organized. I don't have any suggestions.

Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page or web app?
I try to keep all of my work in a folder. I also need to remember to save the websites before I close them.

You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem, where do you find the answer? Why? How do you know?
I try to find my answer in google. If not, I try to find the answer in a book.

What problems have you solved that didn’t involve you coding?
I'm not really sure at the moment.

Talk about your preferred development environment. (What IDE or text editor you enjoy, and why?)
I like to work in a quiet enviornment where I can think clearly. I like beekeeper because it's simple and easy to use.

How are you keeping up with the latest developments in web development?
I read online articles.
